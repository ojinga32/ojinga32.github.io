# 자바의 string과 StringBuffer 및 StringBuilder

	 String is a immutable <br>
	 so it can be changed but it can not append any worlds behind of String <br>
	 however there is a way to append <br>
	 the way is to use StringApi 'StringBuffer' <br>
	 'StringBuilder' is newest API of Java <br>
	 it is a same function as 'StringBuffer' but the only difference is 'MultiThreading' <br>
	 safety API is 'StringBuffer' but complicated. <br>
	 
	 This is really useful api... <br>
	 2023 November 28, i made a code which make a form of json with datas in JavaScript and it was really difficult <br>
	 because there isn't StringBuffer in JS so instead of it, i used += and not only this one, also i used so many 'if' <br>
	 today will be worth it, and im gonna laugh at me because i would think i was a cute when im a juinor developer. <br>
	 
	 Java에서 클래스 레벨에서 선언된 변수는 상수로 간주  <br>
	 StringBuffer를 사용할 때, 코드는 메소드 내에서 또는 초기화 블록 내에서 실행되어야 한다 <br>

```
public class StringBufferStudy {

	public static void hello() {
		String string  = "hello";
		string = "it didnt work";
		StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("hello");
		sb.append(" world5");
		sb.setCharAt(11, ' ');

		StringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer();
		sb2.append("newest");
		
		System.out.println(string);		// it didnt work
		System.out.println(sb);			// hello world
		System.out.println(sb2);		// newest
	}
	
	public static void world() {
		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("test");
		System.out.println(sb);
	}
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		hello();
		world();
	}
}
```
