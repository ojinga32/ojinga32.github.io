# 기본 변수와 참조 변수의 차이점

	 Let's see what is the diffrence between primitive variable And reference variable <br>
	 all variables are allocated on stack memory <br>
	 primitive variable is the value of literal <br>
	 for example : 5, A, true <br>
	 
	 but reference variable is the value of memory from heap <br>

```
public class Variable {
	
	String value;

	public Variable(String value) {
		this.value = value;
	}
	
	Variable variable = new Variable("HeapMemory");
}
```

	 variable is the memory on Stack <br>
	 Variable("HeapMemory") is the memory on Heap <br>
