# no more childhood mind 

While getting a job, I felt keenly that records themselves could be a valuable portfolio for developers.
In fact, I knew it was important, but all my friends around me were still in university, so employment did not come to me much.
But after sending my favorite hair, which I grew long for the first time, to get a job, I said, "Oh, adults can't live doing only what they want to do,
 I felt, "I have to succeed quickly to live doing what I want to do," and I felt that I should do more things I don't want to do in order to improve my skills and values in the future.
 so watch this, I will try to get closer to English, and improve my programming skills.
